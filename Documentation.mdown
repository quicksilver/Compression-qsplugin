Compress Usingâ€¦
  : Allows the object(s) in the first pane to be compressed using one of: `zip`, `tbz`, `tgz`, `cpio`, `cpgz`

## Preferences ##

The plugin adds a preference pane to Quicksilver, allowing you to:

  * Choose whether to compress files to a temporary location first

Event Triggers can be run based on two events in this plugin: Compress and Decompress. For both actions, the "Event Trigger Object" will refer to the archive file.
